# Hi, I’m Mykhailo 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer focused on building **scalable, production-ready web applications** with clean architecture and predictable performance.

I work across the full application lifecycle — from frontend UI systems and backend services to APIs, databases, and CI/CD pipelines — with an emphasis on long-term maintainability rather than short-term fixes.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Designing **modular, well-structured systems**
- TypeScript-first development with clear domain boundaries
- Performance-aware frontend and backend architectures
- Secure authentication and authorization models
- Building systems that scale cleanly as products grow

---

## 🛠 Core Technologies

### Frontend
- **Next.js / React** — SSR & ISR pipelines, scalable component systems
- **TypeScript** — strict typing, shared contracts, predictable behavior
- State management patterns designed for growth

### Backend
- **Node.js / Express** — REST APIs, service layers
- **FastAPI** — async endpoints, dependency injection, clean domain logic
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL schema design, Row Level Security (RLS), real-time channels

### Data & Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** — query optimization, relational modeling
- **MongoDB** — document-based data models
- **Redis** — caching and performance optimization
- **AWS / GCP / Vercel** — cloud-native deployments
- CI/CD pipelines and containerized workflows

---

## ⚡ Key Experience Areas

- SaaS platforms (multi-tenant data models, RBAC, environment isolation)
- Internal business tools and analytics dashboards
- API-driven automation and third-party integrations
- Real-time systems (WebSockets, event streams, live dashboards)
- AI-powered features (automation, personalization, RAG-based search)

---

## 🔐 Security & Auth

- JWT & OAuth authentication flows
- PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- Secure API and data access patterns

---

## 🤝 How I Like to Work

I’m best suited for teams that value:
- Clear communication
- Strong engineering fundamentals
- Steady, reliable delivery
- Systems designed for long-term growth
